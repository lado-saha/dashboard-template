Excellent. This is the perfect next step. A well-designed Super Admin workspace is crucial for the platform's manageability.

You've articulated the core principle perfectly: **the Super Admin sees what the Business Actor sees, but for everyone.** This "god-mode" view requires a different UI approachâ€”less about a single active context and more about powerful, platform-wide filtering and management.

Based on the APIs and your vision, I have designed a complete and logical route structure for the Super Admin workspace. Each route is planned with its specific purpose, key features, and the API endpoints it will utilize.

Here is the comprehensive plan for the Super Admin routes.

### **Super Admin Workspace Route Plan**

This plan outlines the pages that will constitute the Super Admin section of the dashboard, located under the `/super-admin` path.

#### **1. Main Dashboard**

*   **Route:** `/super-admin/dashboard`
*   **Purpose:** To provide a high-level, at-a-glance overview of the entire platform's health and activity. This is the SA's command center.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **KPI Stat Cards:**
        *   Total Users (with active/inactive counts)
        *   Total Organizations (with status breakdown)
        *   Total Business Actors
        *   Total Agencies
    *   **Charts & Graphs:**
        *   **User Registrations Over Time:** A bar or line chart showing new user sign-ups over the last 30 days.
        *   **Organizations by Status:** A pie chart showing the distribution of organizations (e.g., `ACTIVE`, `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `INACTIVE`).
        *   **Business Actors by Type:** A bar chart showing the breakdown of BAs (e.g., `PROVIDER`, `CUSTOMER`, `FARMER`).
    *   **Live Feeds:**
        *   **Recent Global Activity:** A list of the latest significant events (e.g., "Org 'ABC Corp' was created," "User 'john.doe' was disabled," "New Agency 'North Branch' added to 'XYZ Inc.'").

#### **2. User Management**

*   **Route:** `/super-admin/users`
*   **Purpose:** To manage every user account on the platform.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   A `ResourceDataTable` listing all users from the Auth service (`GET /api/users`).
    *   **Search & Filtering:** Search by username, email, or name. Filter by status (`Enabled`, `Disabled`).
    *   **Actions:**
        *   View User Details (in a modal or side panel).
        *   **Enable/Disable User:** A critical moderation tool.
        *   **Manually Verify Email/Phone.**
        *   **Assign/Remove Roles:** (Could also live in the Roles section).

#### **3. Organization Management**

*   **Route:** `/super-admin/organizations`
*   **Purpose:** To view, monitor, and manage all organizations on the platform.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   A `ResourceDataTable` listing all organizations (`GET /organizations`).
    *   **Search & Filtering:** Search by name. Filter by `status` (Active, Pending, Suspended).
    *   **Actions:**
        *   **Approve/Reject Pending Organizations:** Change status from `PENDING_APPROVAL` to `ACTIVE` or `TERMINATED`.
        *   **Activate/Suspend Organization:** Use the `PUT /organizations/{orgId}/status` endpoint.
        *   **View Details:** Link to a detailed, read-only view of the organization's full profile.
        *   **Delete Organization:** A destructive action using `DELETE /organizations/{orgId}`.

#### **4. Role & Permission Management**

*   **Route:** `/super-admin/roles`
*   **Purpose:** To configure the platform's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   A two-panel layout.
    *   **Roles Panel:** Lists all available roles from `GET /api/roles`. Allows selecting a role.
    *   **Permissions Panel:** Lists all permissions from `GET /api/permissions`.
    *   **Assignment Logic:** When a role is selected, the permissions panel updates to show which permissions are assigned to that role (via checkboxes). The SA can check/uncheck permissions and save the changes using the `POST` and `DELETE` endpoints for `/api/roles/{role_id}/permissions`.
    *   Ability to create new roles and permissions using a `FormWrapper`.

#### **5. Global Business Domain Management**

*   **Route:** `/super-admin/business-domains`
*   **Purpose:** To manage the global list of business categories that organizations can select from.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   A `ResourceDataTable` for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) management of `BusinessDomainDto` objects.
    *   Uses the `/business-domains` endpoints.
    *   Creation and editing will be handled by the `BusinessDomainForm` inside a modal.

#### **6. Platform-Wide Resource Views (with Filtering)**

These pages will list *all* entities of a certain type from across the platform, with a crucial "Filter by Organization" control in the toolbar.

*   **Route:** `/super-admin/agencies`
    *   **Purpose:** View and manage all agencies from all organizations.
    *   **Features:** `ResourceDataTable` listing all agencies. **Primary Filter: Select an Organization** to narrow down the list. Actions can include viewing details or disabling.

*   **Route:** `/super-admin/customers`

    *   **Features:** `ResourceDataTable`, filterable by organization.

#### **7. Platform Configuration**

*   **Route:** `/super-admin/settings`
    *   **Purpose:** A settings area for the Super Admin to configure platform-wide parameters.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **API Keys:** Manage keys for third-party services (e.g., email provider, map services).

This plan provides a clear and scalable structure for the Super Admin workspace. We will now proceed with implementing these sections, starting with the most critical: the **Super Admin Dashboard**.
